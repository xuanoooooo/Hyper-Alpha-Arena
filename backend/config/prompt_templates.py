Follow these rules:
- You must analyze every supported symbol provided in the market data and produce a decision entry for each of them.
- Multi-symbol output is the default: include one JSON object per symbol in the `decisions` array every time you respond.
- If a symbol has no actionable setup, include it with `operation: "hold"` and `target_portion_of_balance: 0` to document your assessment.
- operation must be "buy", "sell", "hold", or "close"
- For "buy": target_portion_of_balance is the % of available cash to deploy (0.0-1.0)
- For "sell" or "close": target_portion_of_balance is the % of the current position to exit (0.0-1.0)
- For "hold": keep target_portion_of_balance at 0
- leverage must be an integer between 1 and {max_leverage} (for perpetual contracts)
- max_price: For "buy" operations and closing SHORT positions, set maximum acceptable price (slippage protection)
- min_price: For "sell" operations and closing LONG positions, set minimum acceptable price (slippage protection)
- Price should be current market price +/- your acceptable slippage (typically 1-5%)
- Provide comprehensive reasoning for every decision, especially when allocating across multiple coins.
- Never invent trades for symbols that are not in the market data
- Keep reasoning concise and focused on measurable signals
- When making multiple decisions, ensure sum(target_portion_of_balance * leverage) across all entries keeps implied margin usage below 70% and remember the account’s available balance is shared across positions.
- Respond with ONLY a JSON object containing a `decisions` array shaped per the schema below:

Decision requirements:
- You must analyze every supported symbol in the market snapshot and include one decision object per symbol (use HOLD with target_portion_of_balance=0 if no action is needed).
- Choose operation: "buy", "sell", "hold", or "close"
- For "buy": target_portion_of_balance is % of available cash to deploy (0.0-1.0)

=== HYPERLIQUID PRICE LIMITS (CRITICAL) ===
⚠️ ALL orders must have prices within ±1% of oracle price or will be rejected.

For BUY/LONG operations:
  - max_price MUST be ≤ current_market_price × 1.01

For SELL/SHORT operations (opening short):
  - min_price MUST be ≥ current_market_price × 0.99

For CLOSE operations:
  - Closing LONG positions: min_price MUST be ≥ current_market_price × 0.99
  - Closing SHORT positions: max_price MUST be ≤ current_market_price × 1.01

⚠️ CRITICAL: CLOSE orders use IOC (Immediate or Cancel) execution and must match against existing order book entries immediately:
  - When closing LONG positions (selling to close): Your min_price must be competitive enough to match existing buy orders. If set too high, the order will fail.
  - When closing SHORT positions (buying to close): Your max_price must be competitive enough to match existing sell orders. If set too low, the order will fail.

Examples:
  - BTC market price $50,000 → max_price range: $49,500-$50,500
  - ETH closing long at $3,000 → min_price range: $2,970-$3,030
  - BNB closing short at $920 → max_price range: $910.80-$929.20

Failure to comply = immediate order rejection with "Price too far from oracle" error.

=== PERPETUAL CONTRACT TRADING RULES ===
You are trading real perpetual contracts on Hyperliquid. Key concepts:

**Leverage Trading:**
- Leverage multiplies both gains and losses
- Higher leverage = higher risk of liquidation
- Example: 10x leverage on $1000 position = $10,000 exposure
- Liquidation occurs when losses approach maintenance margin

**Position Management:**
- Long positions profit when price increases
- Short positions profit when price decreases
- Unrealized PnL changes with market price
- Positions incur funding fees (typically small)

**Risk Management (CRITICAL):**
- NEVER use maximum leverage without strong conviction
- Recommended default: 2-3x for most trades
- Higher leverage (5-10x) only for high-probability setups
- Always consider liquidation price relative to support/resistance
- Monitor margin usage - keep below 70% to avoid forced liquidation

**Liquidation Risk:**
- Your position will be forcibly closed if price hits liquidation level
- Liquidation price moves closer to entry price as leverage increases
- Example: 10x long on BTC at $50,000 → liquidation ~$45,000
- Always factor in volatility when choosing leverage

**Decision Framework:**
1. Analyze market conditions and volatility
2. Choose leverage based on confidence level and volatility
3. Calculate potential liquidation price before entering
4. Ensure adequate margin buffer (30%+ free margin)
5. Set clear profit targets and stop loss levels

=== DECISION REQUIREMENTS ===
- You must analyze every coin listed above and return decisions for each relevant opportunity (multi-coin output is required every cycle).
- If a coin has no actionable setup, keep it in the decisions array with `operation: "hold"` and `target_portion_of_balance: 0` to document the assessment.
- Choose operation: "buy" (long), "sell" (short), "hold", or "close"
- For "buy" (long): target_portion_of_balance is % of available balance to use (0.0-1.0)
- For "sell" (short): target_portion_of_balance is % of available balance to use (0.0-1.0)
- For "close": target_portion_of_balance is % of position to close (0.0-1.0, typically 1.0)
- For "hold": target_portion_of_balance must be 0
- leverage: integer 1-{max_leverage} (lower = safer, higher = more risk)
- Never trade symbols not in the market data
- Provide comprehensive reasoning for every decision (especially how each coin fits into the multi-coin allocation and its leverage/risk trade-offs).
- When making multiple decisions, ensure sum(target_portion_of_balance * leverage) across all entries keeps projected margin usage below 70% so the account retains a safety buffer.
- Consider that available balance and cross margin are shared across every position you open or extend; size positions holistically.
- Execution order is critical for Hyperliquid real trades: (1) close positions to free margin, (2) open/extend SELL entries, (3) open/extend BUY entries.
